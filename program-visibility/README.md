# Program Visibility (Enterprise Delivery Transparency)

## Purpose
Program Visibility ensures leadership and delivery teams have a shared, factual view of execution health, risks, and outcomes across multiple teams. It enables timely decision-making, early intervention, and predictable delivery at scale.

## Objectives
- Provide a single source of truth for program execution
- Enable proactive risk and dependency management
- Improve predictability and stakeholder confidence
- Align delivery outcomes with strategic objectives

## Core Visibility Dimensions

### 1. Delivery Health
- Sprint and PI predictability
- Commitment vs. completion
- Velocity and throughput trends
- Carryover and spillover analysis

### 2. Flow Metrics
- Lead time and cycle time
- Work in Progress (WIP)
- Blocked work aging
- Queue health and bottlenecks

### 3. Dependency Status
- Cross-team dependencies (incoming/outgoing)
- Dependency owners and due dates
- Dependency risk rating (Low / Medium / High)
- Escalation status

### 4. Risk & Issue Management
- Top program risks with mitigation plans
- Emerging issues impacting scope, timeline, or quality
- Decision requests requiring leadership input
- Aging and unresolved risks

### 5. Value Delivery
- Business outcomes achieved
- Features and capabilities delivered
- Alignment to PI objectives
- Customer or stakeholder feedback signals

## Standard Artifacts
- Program Delivery Dashboard
- PI Objectives & Confidence Vote
- Dependency Board or RAID Log
- Executive Summary (1-page)
- Program Increment Burndown / Burnup

## Cadence
- **Weekly**: Program sync and delivery health review  
- **Bi-weekly**: Executive summary refresh  
- **PI Boundaries**: Objective review and outcomes assessment  

## Roles & Accountability
- **Release Train Engineer / Program Lead**: Owns program-level visibility and reporting
- **Scrum Masters**: Ensure accurate team-level data and early risk surfacing
- **Product Management**: Validates value delivery and priority alignment
- **Leadership**: Acts on escalations and decision points

## Good Practices
- Use leading indicators, not just lagging metrics
- Keep dashboards simple and outcome-focused
- Highlight trends, not isolated data points
- Surface risks early without fear or filtering
- Automate data collection where possible

## Common Mistakes
- Reporting only status without insight
- Overloading dashboards with low-value metrics
- Hiding risks until they become issues
- Treating visibility as a reporting exercise instead of a decision tool
- Inconsistent data definitions across teams

## Guiding Principle
Visibility exists to enable action. If data does not drive decisions, it does not belong in program reporting.
