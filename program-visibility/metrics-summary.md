# Executive Metrics Summary (Program Visibility)

This document defines a concise, outcome-oriented set of metrics used to provide leadership with clear visibility into delivery health, predictability, and value realization across a scaled Agile program.

---

## Purpose

To enable informed decision-making by presenting a small, consistent, and trustworthy set of metrics that answer:
- Are we delivering predictably?
- Are we flowing work efficiently?
- Are we delivering business value?
- Where are risks emerging?

---

## Principles

- **Few but meaningful**: Prefer signal over volume.
- **Trend over point-in-time**: Direction matters more than snapshots.
- **Outcome-focused**: Metrics inform decisions, not performance theater.
- **Actionable**: Each metric has an explicit interpretation and response.

---

## Core Executive Metrics

### 1. Predictability

**Commitment Reliability**
- Planned vs. completed work per PI / Sprint
- Expressed as a percentage and trend

**Why it matters**
- Indicates planning quality and execution stability

**Executive signal**
- Sustained <85% signals overcommitment or systemic disruption

---

### 2. Flow Efficiency

**Cycle Time**
- Average time from “In Progress” to “Done”

**Throughput**
- Completed items per sprint / iteration

**Work in Progress (WIP)**
- Average concurrent work items per team

**Why it matters**
- Reveals bottlenecks and context-switching

**Executive signal**
- Rising cycle time with flat throughput indicates flow breakdown

---

### 3. Value Delivery

**Business Outcome Progress**
- Features delivered mapped to stated business objectives
- Qualitative + quantitative confirmation

**Increment Acceptance Rate**
- % of work accepted without rework

**Why it matters**
- Confirms value realization, not just output

**Executive signal**
- High delivery with low acceptance indicates misalignment on value

---

### 4. Quality & Sustainability

**Defect Escape Rate**
- Production defects attributable to recent increments

**Rework Percentage**
- Work reopened after “Done”

**Team Health Indicators**
- Capacity stability, attrition, sustained velocity

**Why it matters**
- Protects long-term delivery capability

**Executive signal**
- Improving speed with declining quality is a risk pattern

---

### 5. Dependency & Risk Exposure

**Open Cross-Team Dependencies**
- Count and aging of unresolved dependencies

**Risk Trend**
- Identified vs. mitigated risks over time

**Why it matters**
- Dependencies and risks drive missed commitments

**Executive signal**
- Aging dependencies without owners require escalation

---

## Standard Executive View (One-Page)

- Predictability trend (PI and sprint)
- Cycle time & throughput trend
- Top 3 value outcomes delivered
- Top 3 risks / dependencies
- Leadership decisions needed this period

---

## What This Summary Is Not

- A team-level performance scorecard  
- A replacement for detailed delivery dashboards  
- A justification artifact  

---

## Usage Guidance

- Reviewed at **Program Sync / Steering forums**
- Updated **once per sprint** (not real-time)
- Owned by **Program / Delivery Leadership**
- Used to **decide, unblock, and prioritize**

---

**Guiding Principle**  
If a metric does not drive a decision or action, it does not belong in the exe
