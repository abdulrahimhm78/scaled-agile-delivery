# Dependency Tracking (Visibility and Accountability)

## Purpose
Dependency tracking ensures identified
dependencies are actively managed,
reviewed, and resolved in a timely manner.

## Tracking Approach
- Maintain a visible dependency register
- Assign a clear owner for each dependency
- Review dependencies regularly
- Escalate when resolution is at risk

## Where to Track
- Program boards
- PI Planning artifacts
- Shared dependency dashboards

## Common Mistakes
- Tracking dependencies without owners
- Reviewing dependencies only during PI Planning
- Escalating too late
