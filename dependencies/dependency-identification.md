# Dependency Identification (At Scale)

## Purpose
Dependency identification ensures teams
recognize and communicate cross-team
and external dependencies early.

## Common Dependency Types
- Team-to-team dependencies
- Shared services or platforms
- External vendors or partners
- Regulatory or approval dependencies

## Good Practices
- Identify dependencies during planning
- Make dependencies visible to all teams
- Assign clear ownership

## Common Mistakes
- Discovering dependencies mid-PI
- Assuming ownership without confirmation
- Tracking dependencies informally
