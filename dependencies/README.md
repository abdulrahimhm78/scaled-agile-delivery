# Dependency Management

This directory defines the **enterprise-grade dependency management framework** used to identify, visualize, track, and resolve dependencies across teams, programs, and value streams in a scaled agile environment.

Effective dependency management is critical to **delivery predictability, flow efficiency, and risk reduction**, especially in large, complex organizations.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this framework is to:

- Proactively identify delivery dependencies early
- Increase transparency across teams and stakeholders
- Reduce delivery risk and last-minute surprises
- Improve flow, predictability, and PI execution success
- Enable data-driven escalation and decision-making

---

## Contents

| Document | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `dependency-identification.md` | Methods and techniques to identify dependencies early (team, program, system, vendor) |
| `dependency-tracking.md` | Standardized approach to track, visualize, and manage dependencies throughout delivery |

---

## Types of Dependencies Covered

This framework addresses the following dependency types:

- **Team-to-Team** (shared services, APIs, data contracts)
- **Cross-ART / Program Dependencies**
- **External Vendor / Third-Party Dependencies**
- **Environment & Infrastructure Dependencies**
- **Security, Compliance, and Governance Dependencies**
- **Business Readiness & Operational Dependencies**

---

## When Dependencies Are Managed

Dependencies are identified and reviewed during:

- Backlog Refinement
- Sprint Planning
- Scrum of Scrums
- PI Pre-Planning
- PI Planning
- Program Sync / ART Sync
- Risk & Dependency Review Forums

---

## Visibility & Tracking

Dependencies are tracked and visualized using:

- Jira (issue links, dependency labels, blockers)
- Program boards (PI Planning)
- Dependency registers
- RAID / ROAM boards
- Delivery health dashboards

Each dependency includes:
- Owner
- Impacted teams
- Required date
- Risk level
- Status
- Mitigation plan

---

## Governance & Escalation

Dependencies that meet escalation criteria (e.g., high risk, cross-ART impact, external blockers) are escalated through:

- Scrum of Scrums
- RTE / Program Leadership
- Portfolio or Value Stream leadership

Clear ownership and decision paths are enforced to prevent stagnation.

---

## Expected Outcomes

When applied consistently, this framework delivers:

- Improved PI predictability
- Reduced delivery risk
- Faster impediment resolution
- Better stakeholder alignment
- Higher confidence in commitments

---

## Target Audience

- Scrum Masters
- Release Train Engineers (RTEs)
- Product Owners / Product Managers
- Delivery Leads
- Program & Portfolio Managers
- Engineering Managers

---

## Continuous Improvement

Dependency management practices are inspected and adapted during:

- Sprint Retrospectives
- PI Inspect & Adapt (I&A)
- Delivery Health Reviews

Metrics and feedback are used to continuously improve dependency flow and resolution speed.
