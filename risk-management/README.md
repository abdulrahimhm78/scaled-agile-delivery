# Risk Management (Program-Level Delivery Control)

Execution discipline for identifying, assessing, mitigating, and escalating risks in scaled Agile environments to protect delivery outcomes and business objectives.

---

## Purpose

To proactively manage delivery, technical, and organizational risks across teams and programs, ensuring predictable execution and timely decision-making.

---

## Risk Categories

- **Delivery Risks**  
  Scope volatility, overcommitment, missed dependencies, capacity constraints

- **Technical Risks**  
  Architecture gaps, integration failures, technical debt accumulation, environment instability

- **Dependency Risks**  
  Cross-team dependencies, vendor dependencies, shared services bottlenecks

- **Operational Risks**  
  Resource availability, skill gaps, tooling limitations, support load

- **Business Risks**  
  Priority shifts, regulatory constraints, funding changes, stakeholder misalignment

---

## Risk Identification

Risks are identified through:

- PI Planning (ROAM board, confidence vote discussions)
- Scrum of Scrums / ART Sync
- Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives
- Dependency tracking forums
- Metrics signals (slippage, spillover, cycle time degradation)

All identified risks must be explicitly documented and visible.

---

## Risk Assessment Criteria

Each risk is assessed using:

- **Impact**: Low / Medium / High  
- **Likelihood**: Low / Medium / High  
- **Time Sensitivity**: Immediate / Near-term / Long-term  

This assessment drives prioritization and escalation urgency.

---

## Risk Response Strategies

- **Mitigate** – Take action to reduce likelihood or impact  
- **Avoid** – Change plan or scope to eliminate risk  
- **Transfer** – Shift ownership (e.g., vendor, platform team)  
- **Accept** – Acknowledge with monitoring and contingency plans  

Every active risk must have a clear response strategy.

---

## Ownership & Accountability

- Each risk has a **single accountable owner**
- Owners are responsible for:
  - Defining mitigation actions
  - Tracking progress
  - Raising escalation when thresholds are breached

Unowned risks are considered unmanaged risks.

---

## Escalation Guidelines

Escalate when:

- Risk impact threatens PI or release objectives
- Mitigation actions are blocked or ineffective
- Risk spans multiple teams or ARTs
- Decision authority is required beyond the team level

Escalation paths:
- Team → Scrum of Scrums
- ART → RTE / Program Leadership
- Program → Portfolio / Executive Governance

---

## Risk Visibility

Risk status is maintained through:

- Program risk register
- PI objectives tracking
- Executive dashboards (RAG status)
- Regular ART Sync or Program Sync reviews

Hidden risks are treated as delivery failures.

---

## Success Indicators

- Early risk identification (before impact)
- Timely escalation with data-backed context
- Reduced surprise work and late-stage fire drills
- Improved predictability across PIs and releases

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

- Treating risks as issues after impact occurs
- Escalating without proposed options
- Logging risks without follow-up
- Overusing “accept” as a default response

---

## Guiding Principle

> Risks do not disappear when ignored.  
> Visibility, ownership, and timely decisions are non-negotiable for enterprise delivery.
