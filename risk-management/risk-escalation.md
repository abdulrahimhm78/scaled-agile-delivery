# Risk Escalation (Enterprise Standard)

## Purpose
To provide a clear, consistent, and time-bound approach for identifying, assessing, escalating, and resolving delivery risks in enterprise and scaled Agile environments.

Risk escalation ensures that threats to value delivery, timelines, quality, or compliance are surfaced early and addressed at the appropriate decision-making level.

## Definition of a Risk
A **risk** is a potential event or condition that may negatively impact:
- Delivery commitments
- Business outcomes
- Customer experience
- Regulatory or security compliance
- Team sustainability or morale

Risks are **forward-looking** (not yet realized). Once realized, they become **issues** and require immediate action.

---

## Risk Categories
Common enterprise delivery risk categories include:
- **Delivery Risk** – capacity constraints, missed milestones, dependency delays
- **Technical Risk** – architectural gaps, technical debt, integration failures
- **Dependency Risk** – cross-team, vendor, or external system dependencies
- **Resource Risk** – skill gaps, attrition, PTO overlap
- **Compliance & Security Risk** – regulatory, audit, data privacy concerns
- **Business Risk** – unclear priorities, funding changes, stakeholder misalignment

---

## Risk Levels
Risks are classified using **probability × impact**:

- **Low** – Minimal impact, monitored by the team
- **Medium** – Potential sprint or feature impact, requires leadership awareness
- **High** – Program or release impact, requires escalation and intervention
- **Critical** – Enterprise impact, requires immediate executive action

---

## When to Escalate a Risk
A risk must be escalated when one or more of the following apply:
- The team cannot mitigate the risk independently
- The risk spans multiple teams or programs
- The risk threatens committed delivery dates or scope
- The risk impacts regulatory, security, or customer trust
- The risk remains unresolved beyond one sprint

---

## Escalation Path
Risks are escalated progressively to the lowest effective decision level:

1. **Team Level**
   - Scrum Team identifies and documents the risk
   - Initial mitigation options are explored

2. **Scrum Master / Delivery Lead**
   - Risk is validated, categorized, and time-bound
   - Escalated if mitigation is outside team control

3. **Program / ART Level**
   - Release Train Engineer or Program Manager engaged
   - Cross-team coordination or trade-off decisions made

4. **Portfolio / Executive Level**
   - Leadership resolves funding, scope, priority, or staffing constraints
   - Decisions are documented and communicated back to teams

---

## Risk Escalation Standards
All escalated risks must include:
- Clear description of the risk
- Impacted objectives or commitments
- Probability and impact rating
- Owner responsible for mitigation
- Target resolution date
- Explicit ask or decision required

Escalation is **solution-oriented**, not status reporting.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Scrum Master
- Create psychological safety for early risk surfacing
- Ensure risks are visible and not normalized
- Drive timely escalation when thresholds are met

### Product Owner / Product Management
- Clarify business impact and priority trade-offs
- Support scope or sequencing decisions

### Release Train Engineer / Program Manager
- Manage cross-team and systemic risks
- Facilitate leadership alignment and decisions

### Leadership
- Act decisively on escalated risks
- Remove organizational constraints
- Reinforce a culture of transparency and accountability

---

## Good Practices
- Escalate risks early, not when they become issues
- Use data and facts, not opinions
- Clearly state the decision or support needed
- Track risks until formally closed
- Review recurring risks for systemic improvement

---

## Common Mistakes
- Delaying escalation to “protect optics”
- Escalating without a clear ask
- Treating risks as static rather than evolving
- Normalizing chronic risks as “how things are”
- Failing to communicate outcomes back to teams

---

## Guiding Principle
Unescalated risks become delivery failures.  
Timely escalation is a leadership behavior, not a weakness.
