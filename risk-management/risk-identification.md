# Risk Identification (Enterprise Standard)

## Purpose
Risk Identification ensures that delivery, technical, operational, and dependency risks are surfaced early, documented transparently, and addressed proactively to protect outcomes at scale.

This practice supports predictable delivery, informed decision-making, and timely escalation across teams, programs, and leadership.

---

## Scope of Risks
Risk identification applies across all levels of delivery:

- Team-level execution
- Cross-team and cross-program dependencies
- Platform, architecture, and data risks
- External vendor and regulatory risks
- Operational, security, and compliance risks

---

## Risk Categories
Risks should be identified and classified using consistent categories:

- **Delivery Risks** – capacity constraints, missed commitments, unclear scope
- **Dependency Risks** – upstream/downstream team delays, external handoffs
- **Technical Risks** – architecture limitations, technical debt, performance issues
- **Operational Risks** – environment instability, support load, release readiness
- **People Risks** – skill gaps, attrition, onboarding delays
- **Compliance & Security Risks** – regulatory exposure, audit findings, vulnerabilities

---

## Identification Triggers
Risks must be identified when any of the following occur:

- PI Planning and PI Objectives definition
- Sprint Planning and backlog refinement
- Dependency mapping sessions
- Delivery metric degradation (velocity, cycle time, predictability)
- Repeated spillover or missed sprint goals
- Architectural or scope changes
- External commitments or deadlines introduced

---

## Identification Techniques
Effective risk identification uses multiple inputs:

- Team and program retrospectives
- Dependency boards and PI Planning boards
- Metrics trend analysis
- Architecture and design reviews
- Stakeholder and operational feedback
- Pre-mortem and “what could fail” exercises

---

## Risk Definition Standard
Each identified risk must be documented with:

- Clear risk statement (cause and impact)
- Affected teams or programs
- Likelihood (Low / Medium / High)
- Impact (Low / Medium / High)
- Risk category
- Owner accountable for mitigation
- Target resolution timeframe

---

## Ownership and Accountability
- Teams identify and raise risks early
- Scrum Masters and RTEs ensure visibility and tracking
- Program leadership prioritizes and removes systemic risks
- Executives are engaged for high-impact or cross-program risks

Unowned risks are unacceptable.

---

## Escalation Criteria
A risk must be escalated when it:

- Impacts committed objectives or external deadlines
- Spans multiple teams or programs
- Cannot be mitigated at the team level
- Persists across multiple sprints or PIs
- Presents compliance, security, or regulatory exposure

---

## Good Practices
- Make risks visible before they become issues
- Encourage psychological safety in raising risks
- Review risks regularly, not only when problems occur
- Tie risks directly to objectives and outcomes
- Close risks explicitly once mitigated

---

## Common Mistakes
- Treating risks as issues only after impact occurs
- Hiding or minimizing risks to protect commitments
- Failing to assign clear ownership
- Tracking risks without action
- Escalating too late or without data

---

## Guiding Principle
A risk identified early is manageable.  
A risk hidden becomes an issue.  
A risk ignored becomes a failure.
