# Initial Risk Identified

This document defines the standard approach for identifying, capturing, and communicating risks at the earliest point in the delivery lifecycle. Early risk identification enables proactive mitigation and prevents downstream delivery disruption.

---

## Purpose

To ensure risks are surfaced early, made visible, and addressed before they materialize into delivery issues, missed commitments, or quality failures.

---

## When a Risk Is Considered “Identified”

A risk is considered identified when **any credible threat** to delivery, quality, scope, timeline, compliance, or team capacity is recognized, even if impact and probability are not yet fully known.

---

## Common Risk Triggers

- Unclear or changing requirements  
- External dependencies (vendors, other teams, approvals)  
- Capacity constraints (PTO, attrition, shared resources)  
- Technical uncertainty or architectural complexity  
- Data, security, or compliance concerns  
- Aggressive timelines or fixed-date commitments  
- Tooling, environment, or access limitations  

---

## Required Information at Identification

At minimum, the following must be captured:

- **Risk description** – Clear, concise statement of the risk  
- **Area impacted** – Scope, timeline, quality, compliance, or cost  
- **Source** – Team, dependency, technology, or external factor  
- **Date identified**  
- **Initial owner** – Person accountable for next steps  

Incomplete information must **not** delay risk logging.

---

## Initial Classification (Lightweight)

At identification, apply a preliminary classification:

- **Impact**: Low / Medium / High  
- **Likelihood**: Low / Medium / High  

This classification is directional and may be refined later.

---

## Visibility Expectations

Once identified, risks must be:

- Logged in the agreed risk register or tracking system  
- Visible to delivery leadership and impacted stakeholders  
- Reviewed in the appropriate forum (Scrum of Scrums, Program Sync, or Risk Review)  

No identified risk should remain private or undocumented.

---

## Immediate Actions

Upon identification:

- Acknowledge the risk openly  
- Assign a temporary owner  
- Determine if immediate escalation is required  
- Schedule follow-up for analysis and mitigation planning  

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Waiting for “perfect” information before logging a risk  
- Treating risks as issues only after impact occurs  
- Keeping risks within a single team when impact is broader  
- Framing risks as personal failures instead of system signals  

---

## Guiding Principle

> A risk identified early is a leadership opportunity.  
> A risk identified late is a delivery failure.

Early visibility enables choice, control, and trust.
