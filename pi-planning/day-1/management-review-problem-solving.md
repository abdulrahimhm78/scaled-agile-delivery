# Management Review & Problem Solving (Enterprise Standard)

## Purpose
To provide a structured, outcome-driven forum for leadership to inspect delivery performance, resolve systemic issues, and make timely decisions that improve predictability, quality, and business outcomes.

## When to Use
- Persistent delivery risks or missed commitments
- Cross-team or cross-program impediments
- Quality, stability, or customer-impacting issues
- Capacity, prioritization, or dependency conflicts
- Metrics signaling negative trends

## Participants
- Senior Leadership / Sponsors
- Product Leadership
- Delivery Leadership (Scrum Masters / Delivery Managers)
- Engineering Leadership
- Architecture / Operations (as required)
- Risk / Compliance (as required)

## Inputs
- Delivery metrics (predictability, throughput, cycle time)
- Risk and dependency logs
- Incident or defect summaries
- Customer or stakeholder feedback
- Prior action items and outcomes

## Agenda (60–90 Minutes)
1. **Context & Objectives (5 min)**  
   - What decision or outcome is required today

2. **Delivery Health Review (15 min)**  
   - Trends vs targets  
   - Areas of concern (not status recitation)

3. **Problem Identification (15 min)**  
   - Clearly define the problem (facts, impact, scope)
   - Confirm shared understanding

4. **Root Cause Analysis (20 min)**  
   - Use structured techniques:
     - 5 Whys
     - Fishbone (People, Process, Technology, Policy)
     - Data validation

5. **Decision & Action Planning (20 min)**  
   - Agree on corrective actions
   - Assign accountable owners
   - Set measurable success criteria
   - Define due dates and escalation path

6. **Risk & Dependency Resolution (10 min)**  
   - Remove or re-prioritize blockers
   - Confirm cross-team commitments

7. **Close & Commitments (5 min)**  
   - Summarize decisions
   - Confirm follow-up cadence

## Problem Statement Template
- **Problem:**  
- **Impact:** (Delivery, Customer, Financial, Compliance)  
- **Evidence:** (Data, metrics, incidents)  
- **Root Cause(s):**  
- **Decision Required:**  

## Action Item Standard
- **Action:**  
- **Owner:**  
- **Due Date:**  
- **Success Measure:**  
- **Status:**  

## Decision-Making Principles
- Data over opinion
- Systemic fixes over local optimization
- Clear accountability (one owner per action)
- Bias toward fast, reversible decisions
- Escalate early when authority or resources are required

## Good Practices
- Focus on outcomes, not explanations
- Limit actions to what can realistically be completed
- Track actions visibly and review every session
- Reinforce psychological safety while maintaining accountability

## Common Anti-Patterns
- Turning reviews into status meetings
- Re-litigating past decisions
- Assigning actions without authority
- Accepting vague or unmeasurable actions
- Deferring decisions without a clear next step

## Expected Outcomes
- Faster issue resolution
- Reduced recurring problems
- Improved delivery predictability
- Clear leadership alignment
- Sustained continuous improvement

## Follow-Up
- Action items reviewed weekly until closed
- Effectiveness validated via metrics
- Learnings fed back into team and program practices
