# Review and Adjustments

This document defines how teams inspect outcomes, incorporate feedback, and make disciplined adjustments to plans, practices, and priorities while maintaining delivery stability in an enterprise environment.

---

## Purpose

To ensure continuous alignment with business outcomes by systematically reviewing results and making data-informed adjustments without disrupting team flow or compromising quality.

---

## When Reviews and Adjustments Occur

- **Sprint Review** – Validate delivered value and capture stakeholder feedback  
- **Sprint Retrospective** – Improve team effectiveness and ways of working  
- **Mid-Sprint Checkpoints (Optional)** – Address emerging risks or blockers  
- **PI / Quarterly Reviews (Scaled Context)** – Rebalance priorities and dependencies  

---

## Inputs

- Delivered increment and acceptance results  
- Stakeholder and customer feedback  
- Delivery metrics (velocity, predictability, cycle time, defects)  
- Risk and dependency updates  
- Retrospective action items and outcomes  

---

## Adjustment Types

### 1. Backlog Adjustments
- Re-prioritize items based on validated learning
- Split, re-scope, or remove low-value work
- Refine acceptance criteria based on feedback

### 2. Plan Adjustments
- Adjust sprint scope only through team agreement
- Re-sequence upcoming work to address risks or dependencies
- Update forecasts using empirical data

### 3. Process Adjustments
- Introduce or refine working agreements
- Improve estimation, refinement, or testing practices
- Address recurring impediments with concrete actions

### 4. Capability Adjustments
- Identify skill gaps or capacity constraints
- Plan targeted enablement, pairing, or training
- Adjust WIP limits or team composition if required

## Decision Guidelines

- Changes must be **evidence-based**, not opinion-driven  
- Adjustments should be **small, reversible, and testable**  
- Protect sprint goals and delivery focus  
- Favor learning over defending prior decisions  

---

## Ownership

- **Product Owner** – Backlog and priority adjustments  
- **Scrum Master** – Process improvements and impediment removal  
- **Developers** – Technical and execution improvements  
- **Stakeholders** – Value feedback and outcome validation  

---

## Documentation Expectations

- Capture decisions and rationale in the backlog or team workspace
- Track action items with clear owners and due dates
- Review the impact of adjustments in the next retrospective

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Making scope changes without team alignment  
- Overreacting to isolated feedback  
- Accumulating improvement actions without follow-through  
- Treating reviews as status updates instead of learning forums  

---

## Guiding Principle

Inspect with honesty. Adjust with discipline. Improve continuously without destabilizing delivery.
