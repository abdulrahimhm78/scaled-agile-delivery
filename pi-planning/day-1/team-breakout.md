# Team Breakout (Collaborative Execution)

## Purpose
Team Breakout sessions enable focused, small-group collaboration to decompose work, resolve dependencies, and produce actionable outcomes that support sprint and program objectives.

## When to Use
- During PI Planning (team breakouts)
- Sprint Planning (story/task decomposition)
- Dependency resolution workshops
- Complex design or integration discussions
- Risk mitigation and sequencing alignment

## Participants
- Delivery Team members (Engineering, QA, UX as applicable)
- Product Owner / Squad Lead
- Scrum Master (facilitator)
- Architects or SMEs (as needed)

## Inputs
- Prioritized backlog items or features
- Defined objectives (Sprint Goal / PI Objectives)
- Known dependencies and risks
- Capacity and constraints
- Definition of Ready (DoR)

## Activities
- Decompose stories/features into executable tasks
- Clarify acceptance criteria and assumptions
- Identify and document dependencies
- Surface risks and mitigation options
- Sequence work based on capacity and constraints
- Align on ownership and accountability

## Expected Outputs
- Refined and sized backlog items
- Clearly defined tasks with owners
- Identified and logged dependencies
- Updated risks and mitigations
- Alignment on execution approach

## Facilitation Guidelines
- Keep discussions outcome-focused and time-boxed
- Ensure equal participation from all roles
- Capture decisions and open questions in real time
- Escalate unresolved dependencies promptly
- Re-anchor discussions to goals when drifting occurs

## Good Practices
- Use visual boards (Jira, Miro, whiteboards)
- Validate understanding through summarization
- Break work into vertical, value-driven slices
- Confirm readiness against DoR before commitment

## Common Mistakes
- Turning breakouts into status updates
- Over-engineering solutions prematurely
- Ignoring capacity constraints
- Leaving ownership unclear
- Failing to document outcomes

## Success Indicators
- Teams exit with clear, actionable plans
- Dependencies are visible and owned
- Reduced rework during execution
- Improved predictability and flow
- Strong alignment with sprint or program goals
