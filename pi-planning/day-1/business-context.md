# Day 1 – Business Context

## Purpose
Establish a shared understanding of **why the work exists**, **what business outcomes matter**, and **how success will be measured** before execution begins. Day 1 focuses on alignment, not delivery mechanics.

---

## Business Problem Statement
Clearly articulate the problem the organization is trying to solve.

- What customer, operational, regulatory, or financial issue exists today?
- What is the impact of not solving this problem?
- Why must this be addressed now?

**Outcome:** One concise problem statement understood by all teams.

---

## Strategic Alignment
Explain how this initiative supports enterprise strategy.

- Corporate or business unit objectives
- Regulatory or compliance drivers
- Market, customer, or competitive pressures
- Technology modernization or cost optimization goals

**Outcome:** Teams understand how their work connects to executive priorities.

---

## Target Business Outcomes
Define measurable outcomes, not deliverables.

Examples:
- Reduce cycle time by X%
- Improve customer satisfaction (CSAT/NPS) by X points
- Increase throughput or capacity by X%
- Reduce operational risk or incidents by X%
- Enable new revenue or market entry

**Outcome:** Clear definition of value to be delivered.

---

## Key Stakeholders
Identify decision-makers and influencers.

- Business Owners / Sponsors
- Product leadership
- Technology leadership
- Compliance, Risk, or Operations partners

**Outcome:** Clear ownership and escalation paths.

---

## Customer and User Context
Describe who benefits from the solution.

- Primary users or customers
- Internal vs external users
- Key pain points and unmet needs
- User success criteria

**Outcome:** Teams build empathy and avoid solution-first thinking.

---

## Scope Boundaries
Clarify what is **in scope** and **out of scope**.

**In Scope**
- Core capabilities required to achieve outcomes
- Critical dependencies

**Out of Scope**
- Nice-to-have features
- Future-phase work
- Unfunded or unsupported requests

**Outcome:** Prevent scope creep and misaligned expectations.

---

## Constraints and Assumptions
Document known constraints early.

- Budget or funding limits
- Timeline or regulatory deadlines
- Technology or architecture constraints
- Resource availability
- Assumptions that must be validated

**Outcome:** Realistic planning and risk transparency.

---

## Success Metrics
Define how success will be evaluated.

- Business KPIs
- Flow or delivery metrics
- Quality or reliability indicators
- Adoption or usage metrics

**Outcome:** Shared definition of success across business and delivery.

---

## Risks and Dependencies (Initial View)
Capture known risks and cross-team dependencies.

- External vendor dependencies
- Regulatory approvals
- Shared platforms or services
- Organizational or change risks

**Outcome:** Early visibility to enable proactive mitigation.

---

## Decision Framework
Clarify how decisions will be made.

- Decision authority (who decides what)
- Escalation paths
- Trade-off principles (scope vs time vs quality)

**Outcome:** Faster decisions and reduced delivery friction.

---

## Day 1 Exit Criteria
Day 1 is complete when:

- Business problem and outcomes are clearly articulated
- Stakeholders agree on priorities and scope
- Success metrics are defined
- Major risks and constraints are visible
- Teams are aligned on why the work matters

---

## Guiding Principle
**If the business context is not clear, execution speed does not matter.**
Alignment precedes acceleration.
