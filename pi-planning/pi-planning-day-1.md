## Agenda (Typical)
1. Business Context
2. Product / Solution Vision
3. Architecture & Technical Guidance

## Key Activities

### 1. Business Context
- Market conditions and customer needs
- Strategic themes and business priorities
- Financial or regulatory considerations
- Success criteria for the PI

**Outcome:** Teams understand *why* the work matters.

---

### 2. Product / Solution Vision
- High-level roadmap and outcomes
- Feature priorities and sequencing
- Scope boundaries and assumptions

**Outcome:** Clear understanding of *what* is expected this PI.

---

### 3. Architecture & Technical Guidance
- Architectural runway
- Non-functional requirements
- Technical enablers and constraints
- Known risks or dependencies

**Outcome:** Teams understand *how* work should be approached technically.

---

### 4. Planning Context & Constraints
- Team capacity and availability
- Known dependencies and shared services
- Compliance, security, or operational constraints

**Outcome:** Realistic planning based on actual capacity.

---

### 5. Team Breakouts – Initial Planning
Teams collaborate to:
- Decompose features into stories
- Estimate and sequence work
- Identify dependencies with other teams
- Surface risks and assumptions

**Artifacts Produced:**
- Draft PI plan
- Dependency board entries
- Initial risk list (ROAM candidates)

---

### 6. Draft PI Objectives
Each team defines:
- Business-facing PI Objectives
- Uncommitted objectives (if applicable)
- Success measures

**Outcome:** Clear articulation of intended value delivery.

---

### 7. Management Review & Problem Solving
Leadership reviews:
- Scope vs. capacity alignment
- Dependency conflicts
- High-risk areas

Adjustments may include:
- Scope trade-offs
- Re-sequencing work
- Resource or priority changes

---

## Outputs of Day 1
- Draft team PI plans
- Draft team PI Objectives
- Identified dependencies
- Initial risk register
- Alignment on priorities and constraints

---

## Good Practices
- Focus on outcomes, not task lists
- Surface risks early and openly
- Encourage cross-team collaboration
- Maintain transparency over optimism

---

## Common Pitfalls
- Planning without validated capacity
- Ignoring dependencies until Day 2
- Treating objectives as commitments too early
- Overloading teams due to external pressure

---

## Guiding Principle
PI Planning Day 1 is about **alignment and discovery**, not perfection. The goal is shared understanding that enables confident commitments on Day 2.
