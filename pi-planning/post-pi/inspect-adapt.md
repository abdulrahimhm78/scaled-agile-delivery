# Inspect and Adapt (I&A)

The Inspect and Adapt (I&A) event is a cadence-based, program-level learning and improvement forum used to evaluate outcomes, identify systemic issues, and commit to measurable improvements.

---

## Purpose

To enable continuous improvement at scale by:
- Inspecting solution and program outcomes
- Analyzing systemic impediments
- Adapting ways of working through committed improvement actions

---

## When It Occurs

- At the end of each Program Increment (PI)
- Typically facilitated by the Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- Involves all Agile Release Train (ART) stakeholders

---

## Participants

- Agile Teams
- Scrum Masters
- Product Owners / Product Managers
- Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- System Architects / Engineering
- Business Owners
- Key Stakeholders

## Structure of Inspect and Adapt

### 1. PI System Demo (Inspect)

**Objective:**  
Demonstrate the integrated solution delivered during the PI.

**Focus Areas:**
- End-to-end value delivery
- Alignment to PI Objectives
- Quality and completeness
- Business outcomes vs expectations

**Good Practices:**
- Demonstrate real, working solutions
- Focus on outcomes, not individual stories
- Highlight trade-offs and learning

---

### 2. Quantitative and Qualitative Assessment (Inspect)

**Objective:**  
Review data-driven performance to assess predictability and flow.

**Typical Metrics Reviewed:**
- PI Objective achievement (Business Value vs Actual)
- Predictability Measure
- Flow metrics (throughput, WIP, cycle time)
- Defect trends and escaped defects
- Dependency aging
- Risk trends (ROAM status)

**Guiding Principle:**  
Data is used for learning and improvement — not performance punishment.

### 3. Problem-Solving Workshop (Adapt)

**Objective:**  
Identify root causes of systemic issues and define improvement actions.

**Recommended Technique:**
- Structured root cause analysis (e.g., 5 Whys, Fishbone)

**Problem Selection Criteria:**
- High impact to value delivery
- Repeated or systemic in nature
- Within ART influence to change

**Output:**
- Clear problem statements
- Root causes validated by evidence
- Actionable improvement hypotheses

---

### 4. Improvement Backlog and Commitment (Adapt)

**Objective:**  
Convert learning into execution.

**Activities:**
- Define concrete improvement actions
- Assign clear ownership
- Establish success measures
- Integrate actions into the Program Backlog or Team Backlogs

**Success Criteria:**
- Actions are small, testable, and measurable
- Ownership is explicit
- Progress is reviewed in the next PI

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- Facilitates the event
- Ensures psychological safety
- Drives focus on systemic improvement

### Product Management
- Validates value outcomes
- Aligns improvements to business priorities

### Scrum Masters
- Support problem identification
- Help teams translate improvements into backlog items

### Teams
- Provide honest input
- Commit to improvement execution

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

- Treating I&A as a presentation-only meeting
- Avoiding difficult systemic issues
- Selecting too many improvement actions
- Failing to track improvement outcomes
- Blaming individuals instead of systems

---

## Success Indicators

- Improved PI predictability over time
- Fewer repeated impediments across PIs
- Clear linkage between I&A actions and delivery improvements
- Increased transparency and trust across the ART

---

## Guiding Principle

Inspect and Adapt is effective only when learning leads to action.  
No improvement action means no improvement.
