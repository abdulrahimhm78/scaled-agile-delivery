# Metrics and Predictability Tracking Throughout the Iteration

## Purpose
This document defines how teams track delivery health, predictability, and execution quality continuously throughout the sprint—not only at sprint boundaries. The goal is to enable early inspection, timely course correction, and reliable commitments.

---

## Guiding Principles
- Metrics exist to **enable decisions**, not to judge individuals
- Trends matter more than single data points
- Predictability improves through **consistency and transparency**
- Metrics are reviewed **daily, weekly, and per sprint**, not only in retrospectives

---

## Core Metrics Tracked During the Sprint

### 1. Sprint Goal Progress
**What it answers:** Are we on track to achieve the sprint goal?

**Tracked via:**
- Sprint Goal health (Green / Yellow / Red)
- Remaining work tied directly to sprint goal items

**Reviewed:**
- Daily Scrum
- Mid-sprint health check

**Signals to watch:**
- Sprint goal stories blocked
- Work completed that does not contribute to the sprint goal

---

### 2. Remaining Work Trend (Burndown / Burnup)
**What it answers:** Is work completing at a sustainable and predictable pace?

**Tracked via:**
- Sprint burndown or burnup chart
- Daily remaining effort updates

**Reviewed:**
- Daily Scrum
- Scrum Master daily review

**Signals to watch:**
- Flat lines (no progress)
- Late sprint drops (hidden work)
- Frequent scope changes mid-sprint

---

### 3. Flow Health (Work in Progress)
**What it answers:** Is work flowing smoothly or getting stuck?

**Tracked via:**
- Number of items in progress per person
- Time spent in each workflow state

**Reviewed:**
- Daily Scrum
- Board walk-throughs

**Signals to watch:**
- Too many parallel items
- Stories aging beyond expected limits
- Bottlenecks in review or testing stages

---

### 4. Blockers and Impediments
**What it answers:** What is preventing progress right now?

**Tracked via:**
- Active blocker count
- Blocker age (time unresolved)

**Reviewed:**
- Daily Scrum
- Scrum Master daily follow-up

**Signals to watch:**
- Same blocker mentioned multiple days
- External dependencies unresolved past 24–48 hours

---

### 5. Commitment Reliability
**What it answers:** Are we delivering what we commit to?

**Tracked via:**
- Committed vs completed work
- Carryover rate (work moved to next sprint)

**Reviewed:**
- Mid-sprint check
- Sprint Review
- Retrospective

**Signals to watch:**
- Frequent overcommitment
- Repeated carryover of the same items

---

## Mid-Sprint Predictability Check (Required)

**Timing:** 40–60% into the sprint

**Facilitated by:** Scrum Master  
**Participants:** Entire Scrum Team

**Questions answered:**
- Is the sprint goal still achievable?
- Do we need to de-scope, re-sequence, or swarm?
- Are any risks now threatening predictability?

**Outputs:**
- Updated sprint forecast
- Explicit recovery actions (if needed)

---

## Daily Scrum Metrics Discipline

During the Daily Scrum, the team should implicitly or explicitly confirm:
- Progress toward sprint goal since yesterday
- Whether remaining work aligns with time left
- Any new risks to predictability

**Anti-patterns:**
- Reporting status instead of inspecting flow
- Ignoring charts and relying on optimism
- Deferring predictability discussions to the end of the sprint

---

## Sprint Review Metrics (Outcome Validation)

Metrics validated at Sprint Review:
- Planned vs delivered value
- Scope changes during the sprint
- Predictability trend across recent sprints

**Focus:**
- Learning and adjustment, not justification
- Stakeholder transparency on delivery health

---

## Retrospective Metrics (Improvement Focus)

Metrics inspected in Retrospective:
- Predictability trend (improving, stable, declining)
- Root causes of missed commitments
- Effectiveness of mid-sprint adjustments

**Action items must:**
- Address system issues, not individuals
- Be testable in the next sprint

---

## Common Mistakes
- Looking at metrics only at sprint end
- Using metrics for performance evaluation
- Tracking too many metrics without action
- Ignoring trends across multiple sprints

---

## Definition of Predictable Delivery
A team is considered predictable when it:
- Meets sprint goals consistently
- Shows stable delivery trends over time
- Identifies and addresses risks early
- Adjusts plans transparently when reality changes

Predictability is not perfection—it is **reliability with transparency**.
