# Iteration Execution (Enterprise / SAFe-Aligned)

Execution discipline during the iteration is what converts plans into delivered value.  
This guidance defines **how teams execute day-to-day**, manage flow, surface risks early, and maintain alignment to Iteration and PI Objectives.

---

## Purpose

To ensure predictable, transparent, and high-quality delivery during the iteration by:
- Maintaining focus on Iteration Goals
- Managing flow and WIP effectively
- Surfacing and resolving impediments early
- Preserving quality through Definition of Done adherence

---

## Core Execution Principles

- **Value-first execution**: Work is driven by Iteration Objectives, not task completion.
- **Flow over utilization**: Limit WIP to improve throughput and reduce cycle time.
- **Early risk exposure**: Issues are raised immediately, not at the end of the iteration.
- **Quality built-in**: No compromise on Definition of Done to “go faster.”
- **Team-owned delivery**: Teams self-manage execution; leadership enables and removes friction.

---

## Daily Execution Cadence

### 1. Daily Scrum (Team-Level Execution Control)

**Primary Focus**
- Progress toward Iteration Goal
- Blockers and dependencies
- Plan adjustments for the next 24 hours

**Expected Outcomes**
- Clear ownership of next actions
- Visible impediments
- Alignment across team members

**Anti-Patterns**
- Status reporting to Scrum Master
- Problem-solving without decision-makers
- Ignoring blocked work

---

### 2. Work-in-Progress (WIP) Management

**Standards**
- Enforce explicit WIP limits per workflow state
- Prefer finishing work over starting new work
- Blocked items are visually flagged and escalated

**Indicators of Healthy Flow**
- Stable throughput
- Low carryover between iterations
- Short, predictable cycle time

---

## Dependency Management

**Team Responsibilities**
- Identify dependencies before work starts
- Actively track inbound and outbound dependencies
- Communicate risks early to Scrum Master / RTE

**Scrum Master / RTE Responsibilities**
- Escalate unresolved dependencies
- Facilitate cross-team coordination
- Ensure dependencies are visible at program level

**Anti-Patterns**
- “We’ll figure it out later”
- Hidden dependencies discovered late
- Relying on heroics to unblock work

---

## Impediment Handling

**Definition**
Any issue that prevents or significantly slows progress toward the Iteration Goal.

**Escalation Expectations**
- Team raises immediately
- Scrum Master acts within 24 hours
- Program-level blockers escalated without delay

**Examples**
- Environment instability
- External approvals
- Skill or capacity gaps
- Priority conflicts

---

## Quality & Definition of Done Enforcement

**Non-Negotiables**
- Acceptance criteria met
- Code reviewed and merged
- Automated tests executed
- Documentation updated
- Feature is deployable/releasable

**Guiding Rule**
> If it is not Done, it does not count toward progress.

---

## Mid-Iteration Inspection

**Recommended Practices**
- Mid-iteration checkpoint (optional but encouraged)
- Validate progress against Iteration Goal
- Adjust scope early if risks materialize

**Benefits**
- Reduces end-of-iteration surprises
- Improves forecast accuracy
- Reinforces transparency

---

## Metrics for Iteration Execution Health

**Team-Level**
- Flow distribution
- Cycle time
- Blocked work age
- WIP adherence

**Program-Level**
- Iteration predictability
- Dependency aging
- Objective confidence trends

Metrics are used for **learning and improvement**, not performance ranking.

---

## Common Execution Failures

- Starting too much work
- Late discovery of dependencies
- Allowing partially done work
- Treating impediments as “normal”
- Deferring quality to the end

---

## Success Indicators

- Iteration Goals consistently met
- Minimal carryover
- Stable velocity and flow
- Low defect leakage
- High confidence entering Iteration Review

---

## Guiding Principle

> Strong iteration execution is not about working harder —  
> it is about **working with focus, flow, and discipline**.
