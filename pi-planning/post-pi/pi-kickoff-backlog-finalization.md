# PI Kickoff & Backlog Finalization (Enterprise Standard)

## Purpose
The PI Kickoff and Backlog Finalization establishes shared alignment across the Agile Release Train (ART) at the start of the Program Increment. It ensures teams begin execution with a validated plan, finalized priorities, and clear understanding of objectives, dependencies, and risks.

## When This Occurs
- Immediately after PI Planning (typically Day 2 close or within the first week of the PI)
- Before Sprint 1 execution begins

## Participants
- Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- Scrum Masters
- Product Managers
- Product Owners
- System Architect / Engineering
- Business Owners (as needed)

---

## PI Kickoff Objectives
- Reinforce PI Objectives and business context
- Confirm team-level commitments and dependencies
- Validate readiness to start Sprint 1
- Ensure backlog integrity across all teams
- Establish execution and escalation expectations

---

## PI Kickoff Agenda (60–90 minutes)

### 1. PI Context & Objectives (10–15 min)
- Review PI Vision and Business Outcomes
- Confirm committed vs. stretch objectives
- Reiterate success criteria for the PI

### 2. Dependency & Risk Review (15–20 min)
- Walk through cross-team dependencies
- Confirm ownership and resolution timelines
- Review ROAMed risks and escalation paths

### 3. Execution Expectations (10–15 min)
- Sprint cadence and ceremonies
- Metrics to be tracked (predictability, flow, quality)
- Communication and escalation norms

### 4. Q&A and Alignment Check (10–15 min)
- Address open questions
- Validate shared understanding before execution

---

## Backlog Finalization Objectives
- Ensure Sprint 1 backlog is execution-ready
- Confirm Definition of Ready (DoR) compliance
- Validate sequencing aligns with PI objectives
- Remove ambiguity before development starts

---

## Backlog Finalization Checklist

### Program-Level Backlog
- Features prioritized and aligned to PI Objectives
- WSJF or equivalent prioritization validated
- Dependencies reflected and visible
- Risks documented and mitigations identified

### Team-Level Backlog (Sprint 1)
- Stories meet Definition of Ready
- Acceptance criteria clearly defined
- Dependencies explicitly identified
- Stories sized and sequenced appropriately
- Capacity validated (PTO, support, holidays)

### Technical Readiness
- Architecture and design guidance available
- Environments and tooling ready
- Test strategy aligned and understood

## Roles & Accountability

**Release Train Engineer**
- Facilitates PI Kickoff
- Ensures dependency and risk visibility
- Confirms readiness for execution

**Product Management**
- Owns PI objectives and feature priorities
- Confirms business alignment and value delivery

**Product Owners**
- Own and finalize team backlogs
- Ensure stories meet DoR
- Clarify scope and acceptance criteria

**Scrum Masters**
- Validate team readiness
- Surface execution risks
- Reinforce execution discipline

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Teams start Sprint 1 with confidence and clarity
- No unresolved critical dependencies blocking execution
- Backlogs are clean, prioritized, and ready
- Clear ownership for risks, dependencies, and outcomes

---

## Common Pitfalls
- Treating PI Planning as sufficient without backlog validation
- Starting Sprint 1 with partially refined stories
- Ignoring dependency follow-through post-PI Planning
- Allowing scope churn before Sprint 1 begins

---

## Guiding Principle
A strong PI Kickoff and disciplined backlog finalization prevent execution drift and protect delivery predictability across the entire Program Increment.
