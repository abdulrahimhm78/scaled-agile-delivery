# System Demo – End of Iteration

## Purpose
The System Demo validates integrated functionality at the end of an iteration, demonstrating working software across teams and confirming progress toward program and business objectives.

## When This Occurs
- End of each iteration (or sprint)
- Prior to PI-level or release-level reviews
- After code integration and environment stabilization

## Participants
- Delivery Teams
- Product Owners / Product Management
- Scrum Masters / Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- Architecture / Platform Representatives
- Business Stakeholders (as appropriate)

## Inputs
- Integrated increment deployed to a shared environment
- Accepted user stories meeting Definition of Done
- Updated backlog and dependency status
- Known risks and issues

## Demo Scope
- Cross-team, end-to-end scenarios
- Business-relevant workflows (not isolated components)
- Functional, integrated capabilities
- Non-functional highlights when relevant (performance, security, reliability)

## Agenda (60–90 Minutes)
1. **Context Setting (5 min)**
   - Iteration goals
   - Scope of the demo
   - Known constraints or exclusions

2. **System Walkthrough (40–60 min)**
   - End-to-end flow demonstrations
   - Feature highlights by capability
   - Integration points and dependencies

3. **Feedback & Q&A (10–15 min)**
   - Stakeholder feedback
   - Clarifications and questions

4. **Outcomes & Next Steps (5–10 min)**
   - Accepted vs. follow-up items
   - Impact on backlog prioritization
   - Risks or dependencies requiring action

## Success Criteria
- Demonstrates working, integrated software
- Aligns delivered functionality to business outcomes
- Provides transparency into progress and gaps
- Produces actionable feedback for backlog refinement

## Good Practices
- Demo real data and realistic scenarios
- Focus on value delivered, not task completion
- Keep narration concise and outcome-oriented
- Ensure stable environments before the demo
- Capture feedback live and visibly

## Common Anti-Patterns
- Slide-based demos instead of working software
- Team-by-team demos without integration context
- Over-polishing or hiding incomplete work
- Treating the demo as a status update

## Outputs
- Validated increment
- Stakeholder feedback logged
- Updated backlog priorities
- Identified risks, dependencies, and follow-ups

## Ownership
- **Facilitation:** RTE / Scrum Master
- **Content:** Delivery Teams
- **Acceptance & Feedback:** Product Management / Stakeholders

**Guiding Principle:**  
A System Demo proves progress through working, integrated software—transparency over perfection.
