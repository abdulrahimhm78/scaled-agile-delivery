# System Demo

A concise, end-to-end demonstration of how the **Enterprise Scrum Playbook** and **Scaled Agile Delivery** assets are used together in a real enterprise environment. This demo is designed for walkthroughs with executives, delivery leaders, and new teams.

---

## Purpose

- Demonstrate **how Agile standards translate into execution**
- Show **role clarity**, **event discipline**, and **quality gates** in action
- Provide a **repeatable reference demo** for onboarding and leadership reviews

---

## Demo Scope

This system demo covers:

- Scrum Team execution (single team)
- Enterprise standards enforcement (DoR / DoD)
- Scaled visibility (program-level signals)
- Outcome-focused delivery flow

## Demo Scenario

**Context**  
A product team is delivering a customer-facing capability in a regulated enterprise environment.

**Constraints**
- Fixed sprint length (2 weeks)
- External dependencies
- Executive visibility required
- Quality gates enforced

---

## Step-by-Step Demo Flow

### 1. Backlog Readiness Check (DoR)

- Business value articulated
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Dependencies identified
- Item sized for sprint

**Outcome:**  
Only *ready* work enters Sprint Planning.

---

### 2. Sprint Planning

- Sprint Goal defined
- Capacity validated
- Risks surfaced
- Commitment established

**Artifacts Shown**
- Sprint Goal
- Sprint Backlog
- Risk notes

---

### 3. Daily Scrum (Execution)

- Progress toward Sprint Goal
- Blockers raised early
- Coordination decisions made

**Key Signal**
- Team self-manages execution, not status reporting

---

### 4. Sprint Review (Value Validation)

- Working increment demonstrated
- Stakeholder feedback captured
- Backlog adjusted

**Focus**
- Delivered value, not completion percentages

---

### 5. Sprint Retrospective (Improvement)

- What helped delivery
- What slowed delivery
- One or two concrete improvements selected

**Rule**
- Action items are owned and tracked

---

## Quality Enforcement (DoD)

Work is considered **Done** only when:

- Acceptance criteria met
- Code reviewed and merged
- Tests executed successfully
- Documentation updated
- Release standards satisfied

---

## Metrics Highlighted (Optional)

- Sprint Goal success rate
- Blocker aging
- Carryover trends
- Improvement follow-through rate

> Metrics are used for **learning and decision-making**, not performance management.

---

## Executive Talking Points

- Predictability over heroics
- Transparency over status
- Outcomes over output
- Discipline enables speed at scale

---

## Intended Use

- Leadership demos
- New team onboarding
- Agile maturity assessments
- Internal training sessions

---

## Key Takeaway

This system demo shows how **clear roles**, **strong standards**, and **intentional events** create predictable, high-quality delivery in complex enterprise environments.
