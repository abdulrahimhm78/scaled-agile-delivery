# ART Sync (Weekly / Bi-Weekly Alignment)

## Purpose
The ART Sync is a cadence-based alignment forum used to coordinate execution across Agile Release Trains (ARTs), identify and manage cross-team dependencies, surface risks early, and maintain delivery predictability at scale.

This forum is **not** a status meeting. It is an execution alignment and decision-support mechanism.

## Cadence
- **Weekly**: During periods of high dependency, active delivery, or elevated risk
- **Bi-Weekly**: During steady-state execution with low volatility
- Timebox: **60 minutes**

## Participants
- Release Train Engineer (facilitator)
- Scrum Masters / Team Coaches
- Product Management / Product Owners (as needed)
- System Architect / Engineering Leads (as needed)
- Program / Delivery Managers (optional)
- Dependency owners (required when relevant)

## Inputs
- ART Program Board
- Dependency register
- PI Objectives and Sprint Goals
- Risks and impediments (RAID)
- Delivery metrics (predictability, flow, milestones)

## Agenda
1. **Opening & Context (5 min)**
   - Reiterate purpose and decision expectations
   - Confirm agenda and outcomes

2. **Dependency Review (20 min)**
   - New dependencies identified since last sync
   - Existing dependencies at risk
   - Ownership confirmation and due dates
   - Required escalations

3. **Risk & Impediment Review (15 min)**
   - Top execution risks
   - Systemic blockers impacting multiple teams
   - Mitigation plans and escalation paths

4. **Delivery Alignment (15 min)**
   - Sprint / iteration alignment to PI objectives
   - Variances against plan
   - Capacity or sequencing adjustments if needed

5. **Decisions & Actions (5 min)**
   - Decisions made
   - Action items with owners and due dates
   - Items to escalate to leadership

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear ownership of cross-team dependencies
- Early identification of delivery risks
- Alignment on near-term execution priorities
- Reduced surprises at PI boundaries
- Actionable escalations with context

## Good Practices
- Focus on **what must change** to protect delivery
- Visualize dependencies and risks
- Invite only necessary participants
- Enforce ownership and due dates
- Track actions across sessions

## Common Mistakes
- Turning the sync into a status report
- Discussing team-level details instead of ART-level impacts
- Allowing unresolved dependencies to roll forward
- Escalating without a proposed mitigation
- Overloading the forum with non-decision topics

## Ownership
- **Facilitator**: Release Train Engineer
- **Dependency Ownership**: Assigned team or role
- **Risk Escalation**: Program / Portfolio leadership

## Guiding Principle
Alignment happens through transparency, ownership, and timely decisions—not through reporting.
