# Strategic & Portfolio Alignment

Guidance for aligning team-level execution with enterprise strategy, portfolio priorities, and measurable business outcomes.

---

## Purpose

To ensure that delivery teams are consistently aligned to organizational strategy, funded priorities, and value streams—enabling informed investment decisions, predictable outcomes, and transparency from strategy to execution.

---

## Core Principles

- **Strategy drives execution** — work exists to advance strategic objectives
- **Value over output** — prioritize outcomes, not activity
- **Transparency at every level** — clear line of sight from portfolio to team
- **Continuous alignment** — strategy and execution are reviewed and adjusted regularly

---

## Strategic Alignment Model

### 1. Enterprise Strategy
- Vision, mission, and long-term goals
- Market, customer, and regulatory drivers
- Annual and multi-year strategic themes

### 2. Portfolio Objectives
- Strategic initiatives and investment themes
- Defined business outcomes and success measures
- Funding and capacity allocation

### 3. Value Streams & Programs
- End-to-end value delivery paths
- Program Increment (PI) objectives
- Cross-team dependencies and risks

### 4. Team Execution
- Sprint goals aligned to PI objectives
- Backlog items mapped to business value
- Measurable delivery outcomes

---

## Portfolio Alignment Practices

### Objective Definition
- Clearly defined, outcome-based objectives
- Tied to strategic themes and OKRs
- Time-bound and measurable

### Investment Guardrails
- Capacity allocated by strategic priority
- Explicit trade-off decisions
- WIP limits at portfolio and program levels

### Prioritization Discipline
- Value-based backlog ordering
- Economic prioritization (WSJF or equivalent)
- Regular re-evaluation of priorities

---

## Alignment Artifacts

- Strategic themes and OKRs
- Portfolio Kanban
- PI Objectives and Business Value scores
- Program and team roadmaps
- Dependency and risk registers
- Outcome-based metrics dashboards

---

## Roles & Accountability

### Portfolio Leadership
- Own strategic direction and investment decisions
- Approve priorities and funding
- Inspect outcomes at portfolio reviews

### Program / Value Stream Leadership
- Translate strategy into executable objectives
- Manage dependencies and risks
- Ensure alignment across teams

### Scrum Masters / Delivery Leads
- Reinforce alignment at the team level
- Make misalignment visible
- Coach teams on outcome-focused delivery

### Product Owners
- Align backlog to portfolio objectives
- Clearly articulate business value
- Validate outcomes with stakeholders

---

## Metrics for Alignment

- OKR progress and outcomes
- PI Objective achievement
- Flow metrics (throughput, cycle time)
- Investment allocation vs. value delivered
- Dependency aging and risk exposure

---

## Inspection & Adaptation Cadence

- Quarterly portfolio reviews
- PI Planning and Inspect & Adapt
- Monthly strategy-to-execution checkpoints
- Continuous backlog refinement

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

- Projects disconnected from strategy
- Output-based success reporting
- Overcommitting without capacity awareness
- Static priorities despite changing conditions
- Teams operating without clear business context

---

## Guiding Principle

> If work cannot be clearly tied to a strategic objective or business outcome, it should be challenged, deprioritized, or stopped.

Strategic and portfolio alignment is not a one-time activity—it is a continuous discipline that ensures every team’s effort advances the enterprise forward.
