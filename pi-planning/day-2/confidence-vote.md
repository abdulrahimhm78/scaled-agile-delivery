# Confidence Vote (Governance & Team Trust)

## Purpose
A Confidence Vote is a structured mechanism to assess trust, alignment, and leadership effectiveness within a Scrum team or program. It provides a clear, time-bound signal to leadership when confidence is strong, weakening, or at risk—enabling early intervention and corrective action.

## When to Use
- Sustained delivery issues or missed commitments
- Persistent impediments not being resolved
- Leadership or role transitions
- After major organizational or scope changes
- As part of periodic health checks in scaled environments

## Principles
- **Psychological safety first**: No retaliation or blame
- **Transparency**: Outcomes and next steps are visible
- **Action-oriented**: Results trigger concrete actions
- **Time-bound**: Reassess after corrective measures

## Process
1. **Initiation**
   - Facilitated by the Scrum Master or neutral facilitator
   - Scope defined (team, product leadership, program leadership)
   - Voting criteria clearly communicated

2. **Voting Mechanism**
   - Anonymous vote using one of the following:
     - 👍 Confident
     - ⚠️ Conditional Confidence
     - 👎 No Confidence
   - Optional qualitative comments encouraged

3. **Thresholds**
   - **≥80% Confident**: Confidence affirmed
   - **50–79% Confident / Conditional**: Improvement plan required
   - **<50% Confident**: Escalation and leadership intervention required

## Evaluation Criteria
- Clarity of vision and priorities
- Decision-making effectiveness
- Impediment removal and support
- Communication and transparency
- Trust and respect within the team
- Delivery predictability and quality

## Outcomes & Actions
- **Confidence Affirmed**
  - Continue current approach
  - Share positive practices

- **Conditional Confidence**
  - Define a corrective action plan
  - Assign accountable owners
  - Set a review date (typically 30–60 days)

- **No Confidence**
  - Immediate escalation to governance
  - Leadership coaching or role adjustment
  - Formal recovery plan with milestones

## Documentation
- Summary of results (no attribution)
- Agreed action items with owners and dates
- Follow-up confidence vote schedule

## Common Mistakes
- Treating the vote as punitive
- Ignoring qualitative feedback
- Failing to act on results
- Repeating votes without meaningful change

## Guiding Principle
A Confidence Vote is not about removing people—it is about restoring trust, alignment, and effective delivery.
