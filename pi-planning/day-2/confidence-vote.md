# Confidence Vote (Fist of Five)

## Purpose
The Confidence Vote (Fist of Five) is a fast, transparent facilitation technique used to assess alignment, readiness, and confidence across a group before making or validating a commitment.

It enables teams and stakeholders to surface concerns early, build shared understanding, and improve decision quality without lengthy debate.

## When to Use
- End of Sprint Planning (commitment confidence)
- End of PI Planning (team or ART confidence)
- Decision checkpoints (scope, approach, timelines)
- Retrospectives (confidence in action items)
- Change adoption or readiness assessments

---

## How It Works
Participants simultaneously show a number of fingers (or virtual equivalent) representing their level of confidence.

| Vote | Meaning |
|-----:|--------|
| **5** | Fully confident, no concerns |
| **4** | Confident, minor concerns |
| **3** | Neutral or some concerns |
| **2** | Low confidence, significant concerns |
| **1** | Strong objections, cannot support |
| **0 (Fist)** | No confidence, blocking issue |

---

## Facilitation Steps
1. **State the decision or commitment clearly**
2. **Explain the voting scale**
3. **Ask for a simultaneous vote**
4. **Observe the distribution**
5. **Address low votes (0–2) first**
6. **Clarify concerns and adjust if needed**
7. **Re-vote if changes are made**
8. **Confirm commitment and next steps**

---

## Facilitation Guidance
- Do not average the votes; focus on the lowest scores
- Create psychological safety before voting
- Invite explanation, not justification
- Avoid forcing consensus
- Capture concerns and actions explicitly

---

## What to Do With Results
- **All 4–5**: Proceed
- **Some 3s**: Clarify risks and mitigations
- **Any 0–2**: Pause, resolve blockers, or re-scope
- **Persistent low votes**: Escalate or defer decision

---

## Common Mistakes
- Treating it as a popularity vote
- Ignoring low confidence signals
- Pressuring participants to raise votes
- Using it without clarity on what is being voted on

---

## Benefits
- Rapid alignment
- Visible dissent without confrontation
- Improved commitment quality
- Early risk identification
- Stronger team ownership

---

## Enterprise Tip
Use Fist of Five as a **decision-quality checkpoint**, not a formality. A lower-confidence vote is valuable data, not resistance.
