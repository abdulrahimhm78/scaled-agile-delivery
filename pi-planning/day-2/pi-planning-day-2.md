# PI Planning – Day 2 (Execution Commitment & Alignment)

## Purpose
PI Planning Day 2 focuses on finalizing team plans, resolving dependencies, addressing risks, and securing commitment to PI objectives. The outcome is a confident, executable plan with shared accountability across teams and stakeholders.

---

## Key Outcomes
- Finalized team plans for all PI iterations
- Resolved or owned cross-team dependencies
- ROAMed risks with clear ownership
- Committed PI Objectives with business value
- Leadership confidence in execution readiness

---

## Day 2 Agenda (Typical)
1. **Planning Adjustments (Team Breakouts)**
2. **Dependency & Risk Review**
3. **Management Review & Problem Solving**
4. **Final Plan Review**
5. **PI Objectives Scoring**
6. **Confidence Vote**
7. **Closing & Next Steps**

---

## 1. Team Planning Adjustments
Teams refine plans based on Day 1 feedback.

**Focus Areas**
- Validate scope against capacity
- Reconfirm sprint goals per iteration
- Ensure backlog items meet Definition of Ready
- Confirm integration points and handoffs

**Scrum Master Responsibilities**
- Enforce realistic capacity planning
- Surface hidden dependencies
- Prevent overcommitment
- Keep discussions execution-focused

---

## 2. Dependency & Risk Review
Teams review identified dependencies and risks.

### Dependency Validation
- Confirm dependency owners
- Validate delivery dates
- Align on integration sequencing
- Capture unresolved dependencies explicitly

### Risk Management (ROAM)
All risks must be categorized as:
- **Resolved** – No longer a concern
- **Owned** – Assigned to a clear owner
- **Accepted** – Acknowledged with no action
- **Mitigated** – Action plan defined

> No unassigned risks should remain at the end of Day 2.

---

## 3. Management Review & Problem Solving
Leadership reviews plans for feasibility and alignment.

**Leadership Focus**
- Capacity vs. demand
- Critical path risks
- Cross-team bottlenecks
- Strategic alignment

**Possible Adjustments**
- Scope trade-offs
- Dependency resequencing
- Resource rebalancing
- Priority clarification

---

## 4. Final Plan Review
Each team presents a concise summary.

**Required Elements**
- Iteration-by-iteration plan
- Key dependencies
- Top risks and ROAM status
- PI Objectives

**Best Practice**
- Focus on outcomes, not task-level detail
- Highlight assumptions explicitly
- Avoid optimistic language without evidence

---

## 5. PI Objectives & Business Value
Teams present committed and stretch objectives.

**Guidelines**
- Objectives must be outcome-oriented
- Business value is assigned collaboratively
- Stretch objectives are clearly labeled

---

## 6. Confidence Vote
All participants vote on confidence in the PI plan.

**Voting Scale**
- 1 = No confidence
- 5 = Full confidence

**Rules**
- If average confidence < 3, address concerns immediately
- Dissenting votes must be heard and discussed
- Confidence reflects plan quality, not optimism

---

## 7. Closing & Next Steps
The event concludes with clear execution alignment.

**Outputs**
- Finalized PI plan
- Committed PI Objectives
- Dependency board baseline
- Risk register with owners

**Post-PI Planning Actions**
- Publish PI Objectives
- Update execution tools (Jira/Azure DevOps)
- Schedule Scrum of Scrums cadence
- Align metrics and reporting expectations

---

## Common Pitfalls
- Carrying unresolved dependencies forward
- Treating confidence vote as symbolic
- Overloading teams post-management review
- Ignoring integration and enablement work

---

## Guiding Principle
A successful Day 2 ends with **shared commitment, visible risk ownership, and realistic execution plans**—not perfect certainty.
