# Program Risk & ROAM (Enterprise Standard)

## Purpose
To provide a consistent, enterprise-grade approach for identifying, assessing, and managing program-level risks using the ROAM (Resolved, Owned, Accepted, Mitigated) framework to enable transparency, accountability, and predictable delivery.

---

## Scope
This standard applies to:
- Agile Release Trains (ARTs)
- Multi-team programs
- Portfolio and value stream initiatives
- SAFe and enterprise-scaled Agile environments

---

## What Is Program Risk
Program risk represents any uncertainty that may impact the ability to deliver committed objectives, timelines, quality, or value across multiple teams or dependencies.

Examples include:
- Cross-team or cross-system dependencies
- Capacity or skill constraints
- External vendor or platform dependencies
- Architectural or technical debt risks
- Regulatory, compliance, or security concerns

---

## Risk Identification
Risks should be identified continuously through:
- PI Planning (primary source)
- Dependency mapping sessions
- Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives
- Program Sync / Scrum of Scrums
- Architecture and design reviews
- Executive and stakeholder feedback

All identified risks must be explicitly captured and visible.

---

## ROAM Framework Definitions

### Resolved
- The risk no longer exists
- Root cause has been eliminated
- No further action required

**Example:** A dependency is removed due to a design change.

---

### Owned
- A clear owner is accountable
- Active tracking and follow-up in place
- Resolution path defined

**Example:** A dependency on another ART with a named owner and due date.

---

### Accepted
- Risk is acknowledged and understood
- Impact is acceptable to the business
- No further mitigation planned

**Example:** A known delay with minimal business impact.

---

### Mitigated
- Actions are defined to reduce impact or likelihood
- Progress is tracked until risk is reduced or resolved

**Example:** Adding buffer capacity or alternative delivery options.

---

## Risk Ownership
Each risk must have:
- A single accountable owner
- A clear description and impact statement
- A target resolution or review date
- A current ROAM status

Ownership typically resides with:
- Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- Program Manager
- System Architect
- Senior Scrum Master (for cross-team risks)

---

## Risk Visibility & Tracking
Program risks must be:
- Captured in a central risk register or tool
- Reviewed during Program Sync or ART Sync
- Escalated when thresholds are exceeded
- Included in executive and portfolio reporting

Recommended visibility mechanisms:
- Program boards
- Dependency maps
- Executive dashboards
- PI risk summaries

---

## Escalation Guidelines
Escalate risks when:
- Delivery commitments are at risk
- Dependencies are blocked beyond one sprint
- No clear owner is available
- Risk impact crosses agreed thresholds

Escalation paths may include:
- RTE to Portfolio Management
- Program leadership to executives
- ART-level governance forums

---

## Good Practices
- Address risks early during PI Planning
- Keep risk statements clear and actionable
- Limit accepted risks to intentional decisions
- Regularly revisit ROAM status
- Tie mitigation actions to backlog items when possible

---

## Common Mistakes
- Treating risks as status items
- Allowing risks to remain unowned
- Overusing “Accepted” to avoid action
- Failing to revisit risks after PI Planning
- Hiding risks until delivery is impacted

---

## Guiding Principle
Unmanaged risk is unmanaged delivery. Visibility, ownership, and disciplined follow-up are essential for predictable program execution.
