# Team PI Objectives Readout

## Purpose
Team PI Objectives Readouts provide a structured, transparent mechanism for teams to communicate PI commitments, progress, and outcomes to stakeholders. This readout reinforces alignment, enables early risk detection, and supports objective-based execution at scale.

## When This Is Used
- During PI Planning (initial objective commitment)
- Mid-PI or System Demo checkpoints (progress validation)
- End of PI (objective achievement assessment)

## Audience
- Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- Product Management
- Business Owners
- System Architects / Engineering Leadership
- Dependent teams and shared services

---

## Readout Structure (Standard)

### 1. Team Overview
- **Team Name**
- **ART / Program**
- **PI Name**
- **Iteration Range**
- **Primary Business Stakeholders**

---

### 2. Committed PI Objectives
List only objectives committed during PI Planning.

| # | Objective Statement | Business Value | Commitment |
|---|---------------------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | Clear, outcome-oriented objective | 1–10 | Committed |
| 2 | Clear, outcome-oriented objective | 1–10 | Committed |

**Guidance**
- Objectives must be outcome-based, not task-based
- Avoid technical-only language
- Business value is relative within the PI

---

### 3. Uncommitted PI Objectives (If Applicable)
Objectives dependent on external factors or capacity trade-offs.

| # | Objective Statement | Dependency / Risk |
|---|---------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Outcome-based objective | External team / platform |

---

### 4. Progress Status (Mid-PI or End-PI)
Used to inspect execution health.

| Objective | Status | Confidence | Notes |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Obj #1 | On Track / At Risk / Missed | High / Medium / Low | Key factors |
| Obj #2 | On Track / At Risk / Missed | High / Medium / Low | Key factors |

**Status Definitions**
- **On Track**: Expected to complete within PI
- **At Risk**: Material risk exists; mitigation in progress
- **Missed**: Will not be achieved as defined

---

### 5. Risks and Dependencies
Highlight only material items that impact objectives.

| Risk / Dependency | Impacted Objective | Mitigation / Owner |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Description | Obj # | Action / Name |

---

### 6. Business Value Achieved (End of PI)
Completed during PI close.

| Objective | Planned BV | Actual BV | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Obj #1 | 8 | 7 | Partial scope delivered |
| Obj #2 | 5 | 5 | Fully achieved |

**Guiding Rule**
Business Owners assign Actual Business Value collaboratively with the team.

---

### 7. Key Learnings
- What enabled successful delivery
- What limited execution
- What should change next PI

---

### 8. Improvement Commitments (Next PI)
Concrete actions the team commits to improving execution.

| Improvement | Owner | Applied Next PI |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| Example: Earlier dependency validation | Team | Yes |

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Treating readouts as status decks
- Inflating business value
- Hiding missed objectives
- Reporting tasks instead of outcomes
- Overloading slides with detail

---

## Success Indicators
- Clear linkage between objectives and delivered value
- Early escalation of risks
- Trust-based conversations with stakeholders
- Predictable PI execution over time

---

## Guiding Principle
PI Objectives Readouts exist to drive learning, alignment, and delivery integrity — not performance theater.
