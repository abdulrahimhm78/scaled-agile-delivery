# PI Planning – Day 2 Team Breakout (Enterprise Execution Guide)

## Purpose
Day 2 Team Breakout focuses on finalizing sprint plans, resolving remaining dependencies and risks, validating feasibility, and committing to realistic, aligned objectives for the upcoming PI.

This session converts high-level intent from Day 1 into executable team-level plans.

---

## Primary Objectives
- Finalize sprint plans for the PI
- Resolve open dependencies and risks
- Validate capacity and scope alignment
- Confirm PI Objectives and confidence
- Prepare teams for commitment and execution

---

## Inputs
- Draft PI Objectives from Day 1
- Program Board with identified dependencies
- Team capacity (availability, PTO, support load)
- Backlog refined to Definition of Ready
- Architectural and compliance constraints

---

## Team Activities

### 1. Sprint Planning (PI Horizon)
- Break PI scope into sprint-sized increments
- Sequence features and stories logically
- Ensure each sprint has a clear outcome
- Balance feature work with enablers and technical debt

**Key Question:**  
Can this team realistically deliver this plan with known constraints?

---

### 2. Dependency Resolution
- Review all inbound and outbound dependencies
- Confirm owners and due dates
- Escalate unresolved or high-risk dependencies to the program level
- Update the Program Board as needed

**Rule:**  
Unowned dependencies are unmanaged risks.

---

### 3. Risk Review and ROAM
Teams reassess risks identified on Day 1 and apply ROAM where possible:
- **Resolved** – No longer a concern
- **Owned** – Clear owner assigned
- **Accepted** – Acknowledged and monitored
- **Mitigated** – Action plan in place

Unresolved risks are escalated to the Release Train Engineer (RTE).

---

### 4. Capacity and Feasibility Check
- Validate sprint load against capacity
- Adjust scope to protect sustainable pace
- Ensure support and operational work is accounted for
- Remove hidden or assumed work

**Anti-pattern:** Planning to 100% capacity.

---

### 5. Finalize PI Objectives
- Refine PI Objectives to be clear and outcome-focused
- Ensure alignment with business priorities
- Assign Business Value collaboratively with Business Owners
- Identify stretch objectives explicitly

---

## Outputs
- Finalized sprint plans for the PI
- Updated Program Board
- Confirmed dependencies and owners
- ROAMed risk list
- Final PI Objectives with Business Value
- Team confidence assessment

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Team
- Owns feasibility and delivery plan
- Identifies risks and dependencies early
- Commits only to realistic objectives

### Scrum Master
- Facilitates planning and risk conversations
- Ensures capacity realism
- Drives dependency and risk transparency

### Product Owner
- Clarifies scope and priorities
- Aligns objectives with business outcomes
- Confirms acceptance criteria and sequencing

### RTE
- Supports dependency resolution
- Aggregates risks and escalations
- Prepares for final confidence vote

---

## Common Mistakes
- Carrying unresolved dependencies into commitment
- Overloading early sprints
- Treating stretch objectives as guaranteed
- Ignoring operational or support work
- Deferring risk conversations

---

## Success Indicators
- Teams express high confidence in plans
- Dependencies have clear owners and dates
- Risks are transparent and actively managed
- Sprint plans reflect sustainable delivery
- PI Objectives are outcome-driven, not task lists

---

## Guiding Principle
**Commit to what you can deliver—not what you hope to deliver.**
