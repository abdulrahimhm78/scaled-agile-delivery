# Agile Release Train (ART) Commitment

## Purpose
ART Commitment establishes a clear, shared agreement on **what the Agile Release Train will deliver**, **within known constraints**, during a Program Increment (PI). It aligns teams, Product Management, and business stakeholders on **scope, priorities, risks, and capacity** to enable predictable, value-driven execution.

## Definition
ART Commitment is a **collective, capacity-based commitment** made by all teams on the Agile Release Train at the conclusion of PI Planning. It reflects **realistic delivery expectations**, not aspirational targets.

## Principles
- **Capacity-based planning** over wishful thinking
- **Transparency** of scope, dependencies, and risks
- **Shared ownership** across teams and leadership
- **Commit to value**, not tasks
- **Adaptability** when assumptions change

## Inputs
- Prioritized Program Backlog
- Team capacity and availability (PTO, support load)
- Identified cross-team dependencies
- Known risks and assumptions
- Architectural and compliance constraints
- Business objectives and success measures

## Commitment Scope
The ART commits to:
- **PI Objectives** (business outcomes)
- **Committed Features** aligned to capacity
- **Risk mitigation plans** (ROAMed risks)
- **Dependency ownership and sequencing**

The ART does **not** commit to:
- Fixed scope regardless of change
- Individual story-level guarantees
- Delivery without addressing unmanaged risks

## Commitment Process
1. **Team Planning**
   - Teams plan sprint-by-sprint capacity
   - Dependencies and risks identified early
2. **Draft PI Objectives**
   - Business value articulated per objective
   - Stretch objectives clearly labeled
3. **Risk ROAMing**
   - Risks are Resolved, Owned, Accepted, or Mitigated
4. **Confidence Vote**
   - Teams vote on confidence (1–5)
   - Low confidence triggers replanning
5. **ART Commitment**
   - Collective agreement captured and communicated

## Roles and Responsibilities
### Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- Facilitates commitment process
- Ensures risks and dependencies are visible
- Protects realism in planning

### Product Management
- Owns feature prioritization
- Clarifies business value and trade-offs
- Accepts scope adjustments when needed

### Scrum Masters
- Ensure team capacity realism
- Surface impediments and risks
- Reinforce commitment discipline

### Teams
- Commit based on actual capacity
- Own delivery of PI Objectives
- Escalate risks early

### Business Owners
- Validate objectives and value
- Support trade-off decisions
- Participate in confidence assessment

## Confidence Thresholds
- **4–5**: Proceed with commitment
- **3**: Review risks and adjust scope
- **1–2**: Replan required before commitment

## Metrics and Validation
- PI Objective achievement
- Predictability Measure
- Dependency burn-down
- Risk trend over the PI
- Feature completion vs. commitment

## Common Anti-Patterns
- Overcommitting to satisfy stakeholders
- Treating stretch objectives as mandatory
- Ignoring capacity constraints
- Deferring risk discussions
- Recommitting mid-PI without re-alignment

## Governing Rule
**The ART commits only to what it can realistically deliver with known capacity and managed risk.**

Commitment without transparency is a plan failure waiting to happen.
