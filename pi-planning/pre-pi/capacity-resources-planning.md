# Capacity & Resource Planning (Enterprise Standard)

## Purpose
Capacity and Resource Planning ensures teams commit to work based on realistic availability, skill mix, and operational constraints. The objective is predictable delivery without burnout, hidden overcommitment, or reactive re-planning.

## Scope
This standard applies to:
- Agile teams operating within a program or portfolio
- PI-level and sprint-level planning
- Shared services, platform teams, and constrained specialists

## Guiding Principles
- Capacity is finite and must be respected
- Commitments are based on availability, not demand
- Flow stability is prioritized over utilization
- Transparency enables better trade-off decisions

## Capacity Components
Capacity must account for all known and expected factors:

- Team member availability (working days)
- Planned PTO and holidays
- Support and operational work
- On-call responsibilities
- Training, ceremonies, and meetings
- Context switching across teams or initiatives

## Standard Capacity Calculation
1. Determine total working days in the sprint or iteration
2. Subtract PTO, holidays, and known absences
3. Apply a support/overhead buffer (typically 20–30%)
4. Convert remaining time into usable capacity (hours or points)
5. Validate against historical throughput

> Capacity should always be validated using past delivery data, not optimistic assumptions.

## Resource Planning at Scale
At the program level, resource planning focuses on constraints rather than utilization.

Key considerations:
- Single points of failure (specialized skills)
- Shared resources across teams
- External dependencies and vendor availability
- Critical path work requiring sequencing

Program leaders must plan around bottlenecks, not average capacity.

## Commitment Rules
- Teams commit only up to validated capacity
- Stretch goals are explicitly labeled and optional
- Unplanned work must displace planned work, not stack on top
- Capacity changes trigger immediate re-planning

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Team
- Provide accurate availability inputs
- Raise capacity risks early
- Protect focus during the sprint

### Scrum Master
- Facilitate capacity discussions
- Guard against overcommitment
- Make capacity visible and transparent

### Product Owner / Program Lead
- Prioritize based on capacity constraints
- Make trade-offs explicit
- Avoid pushing work beyond capacity limits

## Capacity Anti-Patterns
- Planning based on ideal availability
- Ignoring support and interrupt-driven work
- Treating velocity as a target
- Carrying hidden overtime as “normal”
- Assuming full utilization equals efficiency

## Success Indicators
- Stable and predictable throughput
- Fewer mid-sprint scope changes
- Reduced carryover work
- Improved team sustainability
- Clear visibility into constraints

## Key Takeaway
Capacity planning is a decision-making discipline, not a math exercise. When capacity is respected, teams deliver predictably, stakeholders gain trust, and systems operate sustainably at scale.
