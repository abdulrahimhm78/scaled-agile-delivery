# Pre-PI Alignment Event (Enterprise Standard)

## Purpose
The Pre-PI Alignment Event ensures teams, Product Management, Architecture, and stakeholders are aligned **before PI Planning**. It reduces planning risk by clarifying priorities, scope boundaries, dependencies, and capacity assumptions in advance.

This event is **not a replacement for PI Planning**. It is a readiness and alignment checkpoint to enable high-quality PI outcomes.

---

## When This Event Occurs
- 1–2 weeks before PI Planning
- After high-level PI objectives are drafted
- Before teams commit to PI scope

---

## Participants
- Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- Product Management
- Product Owners
- System / Solution Architects
- Scrum Masters
- Engineering Managers (as applicable)
- Business Owners (optional, advisory)

---

## Inputs
- Draft PI Objectives
- High-level roadmap and priorities
- Architectural runway status
- Known cross-team dependencies
- Capacity assumptions (PTO, holidays, production support)
- Outstanding risks and constraints

---

## Agenda (90–120 minutes)

### 1. Business Context & PI Intent
- Reconfirm business goals for the upcoming PI
- Validate priority themes and success criteria
- Confirm non-negotiables and fixed commitments

### 2. Scope Readiness Review
- Review top candidate features / initiatives
- Identify items not ready for PI Planning
- Flag scope requiring further refinement

### 3. Dependency Identification
- Surface known cross-team dependencies
- Identify external or vendor dependencies
- Assign preliminary owners for resolution

### 4. Architecture & Enablers
- Review architectural runway
- Confirm required enablers for planned work
- Identify technical risks or constraints

### 5. Capacity & Constraints
- Validate team-level capacity assumptions
- Identify shared resource constraints
- Highlight competing priorities (support, compliance, incidents)

### 6. Risk Identification
- Identify PI-level risks
- Categorize risks (scope, dependency, capacity, technical)
- Decide which risks must be addressed before PI Planning

---

## Expected Outcomes
- Shared understanding of PI priorities and intent
- Reduced unknown dependencies entering PI Planning
- Clear list of risks to manage during PI Planning
- Confirmed readiness gaps and owners
- Improved confidence in PI Planning commitments

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

### Release Train Engineer
- Facilitate the event
- Ensure alignment and time discipline
- Capture risks, dependencies, and decisions

### Product Management
- Clarify priorities and business intent
- Confirm scope boundaries
- Identify unacceptable risk areas

### Product Owners
- Validate backlog readiness
- Highlight team-level constraints
- Surface dependency impacts

### Architects
- Validate technical feasibility
- Identify architectural risks and enablers
- Ensure alignment with long-term strategy

---

## Good Practices
- Focus on alignment, not solutioning
- Be explicit about what is **not ready**
- Document decisions and assumptions
- Assign owners to every risk and dependency
- Keep discussions PI-level, not story-level

---

## Common Anti-Patterns
- Treating this as an early PI Planning session
- Hiding risks to “figure it out later”
- Overloading teams before capacity is validated
- Allowing unclear priorities to persist
- Skipping architecture and enabler discussions

---

## Success Indicators
- Fewer surprises during PI Planning
- Faster dependency negotiation
- Higher confidence PI objectives
- Reduced mid-PI scope churn
- Clear, shared understanding across teams

---

## Guiding Principle
**Alignment before commitment.  
Clarity before planning.  
Risks surfaced early are risks that can be managed.**
