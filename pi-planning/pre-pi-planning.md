# Pre-PI Planning (Enterprise Alignment)

## Purpose
Pre-PI Planning ensures teams, stakeholders, and leadership enter PI Planning with a shared understanding of priorities, scope boundaries, dependencies, and capacity. The goal is to reduce uncertainty, minimize last-minute rework, and enable high-quality commitments during PI Planning.

## When This Occurs
- 2–4 weeks before PI Planning
- Iterative touchpoints may occur weekly leading up to PI Planning

## Key Participants
- Product Management
- Product Owners
- Scrum Masters
- Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- Architecture / System Engineering
- Business Owners
- Key Shared Services (Security, Data, Platform, Ops)

## Inputs
- Portfolio and strategic themes
- Roadmaps and upcoming business initiatives
- High-level feature candidates
- Known regulatory, compliance, or fixed-date commitments
- Historical capacity and delivery metrics
- Known cross-team and external dependencies

## Core Activities

### 1. Scope and Priority Alignment
- Review prioritized features and business outcomes
- Validate alignment to strategic themes and OKRs
- Identify scope that is **in** vs **out** for the PI
- Flag fixed-date or non-negotiable commitments

### 2. Capacity and Constraints Review
- Review team capacity assumptions (PTO, holidays, support load)
- Identify shared service constraints
- Validate realistic throughput expectations
- Surface risks related to under- or over-allocation

### 3. Dependency Identification
- Identify cross-team, cross-ART, and external dependencies
- Clarify dependency owners and timing
- Highlight dependencies that must be resolved before PI Planning
- Capture unresolved dependencies for escalation

### 4. Architecture and Enablers
- Review architectural runway needs
- Identify required enablers and technical prerequisites
- Confirm sequencing assumptions
- Validate non-functional requirements (security, performance, data)

### 5. Risk Pre-Assessment
- Identify top delivery risks
- Classify risks (capacity, dependency, technical, regulatory)
- Determine mitigation or escalation paths
- Prepare risks for ROAMing during PI Planning

## Expected Outputs
- Refined and prioritized feature list
- High-confidence capacity assumptions
- Initial dependency map
- Identified enablers and architectural considerations
- Preliminary risk register
- Clear expectations for PI Planning Day 1

## Success Indicators
- Fewer surprises during PI Planning
- Reduced scope churn during team breakouts
- Faster convergence on PI Objectives
- Clear ownership of dependencies and risks
- Higher confidence business commitments

## Common Mistakes
- Treating Pre-PI Planning as a presentation instead of a working session
- Skipping capacity validation
- Ignoring shared services and platform constraints
- Deferring dependency discussions until PI Planning
- Optimizing for optimism instead of realism

## Guiding Principle
Pre-PI Planning is about **alignment and readiness**, not final commitments. Strong preparation enables teams to plan effectively and commit responsibly during PI Planning.
