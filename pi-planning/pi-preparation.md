# PI Preparation (Enterprise Standard)

## Purpose
PI Preparation ensures teams, stakeholders, and leadership enter PI Planning with clarity, alignment, and readiness. Effective preparation reduces planning churn, exposes risks early, and enables realistic, value-driven commitments.

## Scope
This standard applies to all Agile Release Trains (ARTs), Solution Trains, and supporting shared services participating in PI Planning.

## Preparation Timeline
PI Preparation typically begins **3–4 weeks before PI Planning** and concludes before Day 1 of the event.

## Key Preparation Areas

### 1. Business Context & Strategy
- Communicate enterprise and portfolio objectives
- Confirm PI-level business outcomes and success measures
- Share market, customer, regulatory, and technology drivers
- Align leadership messaging across portfolios and ARTs

**Owner:** Business Owners, Portfolio Management

---

### 2. Backlog Readiness
- Features are prioritized and sequenced
- Acceptance criteria are defined at a feature level
- Dependencies are identified and documented
- Features are sized or roughly estimated
- Non-functional requirements are visible

**Owner:** Product Management, Product Owners

---

### 3. Capacity & Team Readiness
- Team rosters are confirmed
- PTO, holidays, and known availability constraints are accounted for
- Shared services and specialty skill availability is clarified
- New team members are onboarded to tooling and ceremonies

**Owner:** Scrum Masters, RTEs, Engineering Managers

---

### 4. Dependency Identification
- Cross-team and cross-ART dependencies are captured
- External dependencies (vendors, platforms, compliance) are identified
- Dependency owners and expected resolution timelines are defined
- Risks associated with dependencies are documented

**Owner:** Scrum Masters, RTEs

---

### 5. Risk & Constraint Review
- Known risks are logged and categorized (ROAM draft)
- Architectural or infrastructure constraints are surfaced
- Regulatory or compliance concerns are clarified
- Legacy system limitations are communicated

**Owner:** RTEs, Architects, Risk Owners

---

### 6. Architecture & Enablers
- Architectural runway is reviewed
- Enabler features and technical debt items are visible
- Major design decisions are communicated
- Non-functional expectations are reinforced

**Owner:** System Architects, Engineering Leads

## Readiness Checklist (Minimum Bar)

PI Planning should not proceed unless:
- Business priorities are clearly articulated
- Top features are ready for team-level planning
- Capacity assumptions are validated
- Major dependencies are visible
- Risks are acknowledged and understood
- Leadership participation is confirmed

---

## Outputs of PI Preparation
- Prioritized and ready feature backlog
- Capacity-adjusted planning assumptions
- Documented dependencies and risks
- Shared understanding of objectives and constraints
- Teams prepared to plan, not discover

---

## Common Anti-Patterns
- Treating PI Planning as backlog refinement
- Finalizing priorities during Day 1
- Ignoring capacity constraints
- Deferring dependency discussions
- Entering PI Planning without leadership alignment

---

## Guiding Principle
PI Planning success is determined before the event begins.  
Preparation creates predictability; lack of preparation creates negotiation.
