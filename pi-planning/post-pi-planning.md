# Post PI Planning (Execution Alignment & Follow-Through)

## Purpose
Post PI Planning ensures that commitments made during PI Planning are translated into executable plans with clear ownership, sequencing, and governance. The focus is on alignment, transparency, and disciplined follow-through across the ART.

## Timing
Immediately after PI Planning (same day or within 48 hours).

## Participants
- Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- Scrum Masters
- Product Management
- Product Owners
- System Architect / Engineering Leads
- Program Management (if applicable)

## Inputs
- Final PI Objectives (committed and uncommitted)
- Program Board with dependencies and milestones
- Team PI Plans
- Identified risks and ROAM outcomes
- Capacity assumptions and constraints

## Key Activities

### 1. Validate PI Objectives
- Confirm each team’s PI Objectives are:
  - Clearly stated and measurable
  - Aligned to program and business outcomes
  - Properly classified (Committed vs. Stretch)
- Ensure Business Value scores are documented and visible

### 2. Dependency Confirmation
- Review all cross-team dependencies on the Program Board
- Confirm:
  - Dependency owners (requestor and provider)
  - Target delivery windows
  - Escalation paths for missed commitments
- Convert critical dependencies into tracked work items where applicable

### 3. Risk Follow-Up (ROAM)
- Re-review ROAMed risks
- Assign explicit owners and next actions
- Schedule checkpoints for:
  - Owned risks
  - Mitigated risks requiring validation
  - Accepted risks with leadership awareness

### 4. Capacity & Load Recheck
- Validate sprint-level capacity assumptions
- Reconcile:
  - Planned PTO
  - Production support
  - Shared services or platform dependencies
- Adjust plans early if capacity risks are detected

### 5. Governance & Cadence Alignment
- Confirm cadence for:
  - Scrum of Scrums
  - PO Sync
  - ART Sync
  - System Demos
- Align escalation thresholds and decision authorities

### 6. Tooling & Visibility
- Ensure PI Objectives, dependencies, and milestones are:
  - Entered into the ALM tool (e.g., Jira, ADO)
  - Visible at team and program levels
- Validate dashboards for:
  - Objective progress
  - Dependency health
  - Risk status

## Outputs
- Finalized and published PI Objectives
- Confirmed dependency ownership and tracking
- Risk action plans with owners
- Updated program dashboards
- Clear execution cadence and governance model

## Success Indicators
- No ambiguity in PI Objectives or ownership
- Dependencies actively tracked before becoming blockers
- Risks addressed proactively, not reactively
- Teams start Iteration 1 with clarity and confidence

## Common Pitfalls
- Treating PI Planning as “done” once the event ends
- Leaving dependencies unowned or loosely defined
- Delaying risk follow-up until issues surface
- Assuming capacity plans will “work themselves out”

## Guiding Principle
PI Planning creates alignment; Post PI Planning makes it executable. Discipline in follow-through is what turns plans into outcomes.
