# PI Planning (Program Increment Planning)

## Purpose
PI Planning establishes alignment across all teams on shared objectives, delivery commitments, dependencies, and risks for the upcoming Program Increment (PI). It creates a single, integrated plan that enables predictable execution at scale.

## When It Occurs
- Once per Program Increment (typically every 8–12 weeks)
- Conducted over **2 full days** (or equivalent time-box if virtual)

## Participants
- Agile Release Train (ART) teams
- Product Management
- Product Owners
- Scrum Masters
- Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- System Architect / Engineering
- Business Owners
- Key Stakeholders

## Inputs
- Vision and strategic themes
- Top prioritized features and enablers
- Architecture runway and constraints
- Capacity and availability by team
- Known dependencies and risks
- Prior PI performance insights

## Day 1 – Alignment & Planning
### Objectives
- Establish a shared understanding of business priorities
- Enable teams to draft initial PI plans

### Key Activities
- Business context and vision briefing
- Architecture and technical guidance
- Team breakout planning (features → stories)
- Dependency identification and negotiation
- Initial risk identification (ROAM)

### Expected Outcomes
- Draft team PI objectives
- Identified cross-team dependencies
- Initial risks documented

## Day 2 – Commitment & Confidence
### Objectives
- Finalize plans and confirm delivery confidence

### Key Activities
- Plan refinement and dependency resolution
- Final risk ROAMing (Resolved, Owned, Accepted, Mitigated)
- Business Owner review and scoring
- Confidence vote across teams

### Expected Outcomes
- Finalized team and program PI objectives
- Agreed dependency management approach
- Clear risk ownership
- ART-level commitment

## PI Objectives
- Written, outcome-focused, and measurable
- Include both committed and stretch objectives
- Owned by teams and visible at program level

## Risks & ROAM
- **Resolved**: No longer a concern
- **Owned**: Assigned owner
- **Accepted**: Understood and acknowledged
- **Mitigated**: Action plan defined

## Roles & Responsibilities
### Release Train Engineer (RTE)
- Facilitate PI Planning end-to-end
- Ensure time-box discipline and flow
- Drive risk and dependency visibility

### Scrum Masters
- Support team planning and facilitation
- Surface impediments and risks
- Ensure realistic commitments

### Product Owners
- Clarify scope, priorities, and acceptance criteria
- Align team plans to features and objectives

### Business Owners
- Provide strategic guidance

- Participate in confidence voting

## Good Practices
- Plan based on capacity, not optimism
- Make dependencies explicit and visible
- Prioritize outcomes over output
- Encourage open discussion and transparency

## Common Pitfalls
- Overcommitting due to external pressure
- Treating PI Planning as a presentation
- Ignoring capacity and technical debt
- Deferring risk ownership

## Success Indicators
- High confidence vote across teams
- Clear, aligned PI objectives
- Managed and visible dependencies
- Predictable execution throughout the PI
