# Program Backlog Readiness (Enterprise Standard)

## Purpose
Program Backlog Readiness ensures that features and enablers are sufficiently defined, prioritized, and validated before entering PI Planning. The goal is to enable predictable execution, reduce delivery risk, and improve alignment across teams on the Agile Release Train (ART).

## Definition
A program backlog item is considered **ready** when it meets the minimum criteria required for teams to confidently plan, commit, and execute during a Program Increment.

## Readiness Criteria

### Strategic Alignment
- Clearly aligned to program objectives and business outcomes  
- Traceable to portfolio themes, OKRs, or strategic initiatives  
- Value hypothesis is articulated and understood  

### Scope & Clarity
- Feature intent and scope are clearly defined  
- Non-functional requirements (security, performance, compliance) are identified  
- Acceptance criteria are documented at the feature level  

### Dependencies & Risks
- Cross-team and external dependencies are identified and visible  
- Major risks are documented with mitigation approaches  
- Dependency owners are known  

### Estimation & Sizing
- High-level sizing completed (relative estimation or WSJF inputs)  
- Feature is appropriately sized for delivery within a PI  
- Large or unclear items are split or deferred  

### Architectural & Technical Readiness
- Architectural implications are reviewed with System/Enterprise Architects  
- Enablers are identified where needed  
- No unresolved technical constraints blocking planning  

### Stakeholder Validation
- Business Owners and key stakeholders have reviewed the item  
- Priority is agreed and understood  
- Open questions are resolved or explicitly deferred  

## Inputs
- Portfolio and program priorities  
- Updated roadmap and objectives  
- Dependency and risk registers  
- Architectural guidance  

## Outputs
- Ready-to-plan program backlog  
- Clear feature priorities for PI Planning  
- Reduced uncertainty entering the PI  

## Ownership
- **Primary:** Product Management  
- **Supporting:** RTE, System Architect, Business Owners, Scrum Masters  

## Common Anti-Patterns
- Bringing vague or oversized features into PI Planning  
- Discovering major dependencies during PI Planning  
- Treating readiness as documentation-only instead of shared understanding  
- Deferring architectural or risk conversations too late  

## Guiding Principle
Program Backlog Readiness is about **alignment and confidence**, not perfection.  
If teams cannot confidently plan and commit, the backlog is not ready.
